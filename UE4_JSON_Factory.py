    WHY FILTER THE OUTLIERS
    The outliers generate problems during normalization, most of the elements
    receive a number close to zero while the outliers receive a number close to 1.
    Normalization means giving the elements a percentaje divided by 100, thus the 0 to 1 scale.
    This percentaje is the time at which they are in the timeline, the X dimension.
    Because most of the element receive a number close to zero, they lack precision,
    0.0000000010134012 gets truncated by floating point presicion.
    By removing the outliers, the elements receive bigger percentajes.
    0.1013401223456789<--- winning 8 valuable bits of numerical presicion.
